Mohammed M. Dawoud, Changxin Liu, Amr Alanwar, and Karl Henrik Johansson "Differentially-Private-Set-Based-Estimation-Using-Zonotopes"<br />
<br />
we
propose a differentially private set-based estimation protocol that preserves the privacy of the measurement signals.<br />
Estimation sets are represented using zonotopes, which give a computational advantage for set operations.  <br />
<br /> Our protocol uses a numerically optimized, truncated noise
distribution that jointly minimizes privacy loss and utility loss.
